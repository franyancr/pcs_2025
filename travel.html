    <p> The PCS 2025 Workshop will take place at the main campus of the
      University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. We plan on covering
      lodging and most meals for all workshop participants. In addition,
      we plan on covering the airfare for most graduate students and
      postdocs attending the workshop. We are unfortunately unable to
      cover ground transportation costs outside of New Mexico, but see
      below for free and complimentary options for local ground
      transportation in Albuquerque during the workshop. <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Getting to Albuquerque<br>
    </h2>
    <p> The nearest and most easily-accessible airport to attend the
      workshop is the <a href="https://www.abqsunport.com/">
        Albuquerque International Sunport</a>, which is less than a
      10-minute drive from UNM Main Campus. Ride-sharing apps like Uber
      or Lyft work well in Albuquerque and are usually a cost-effective
      way to get around. Alternatively, <a
        href="https://live.goswift.ly/abq-ride/route/50">ABQ Ride Bus 50</a>
      is free-of-charge and runs between the airport and Downtown,
      passing by UNM along the way. The <a
        href="https://www.hotelparqcentral.com/">Hotel Parq Central</a>
      also has a complimentary shuttle that can pick you up from the
      airport when you arrive. The shuttle is available between 8:00am
      and 9:45pm, and can be requested by calling the hotel when you
      land in Albuquerque.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <h2> Accommodation and local transportation<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Workshop participants from outside New Mexico will stay at the <a
        href="https://www.hotelparqcentral.com/">Hotel Parq Central</a>,
      located about a 20-minute walk from UNM's main campus along
      historic route 66. Breakfast is included for those staying at the
      hotel (starting at 7:00am). To reach UNM from the hotel,
      participants can either walk or take the free rapid transit bus
      route <a href="https://live.goswift.ly/abq-ride/route/766">766</a>/<a
        href="https://live.goswift.ly/abq-ride/route/777">777</a>
      (direction Uptown Transit Center or Central &amp; Tramway) from
      the center platform located at the intersection of Central Avenue
      and Walter street (located 3 blocks west of the hotel) and getting
      off at either the UNM/CNM or the UNM-Popejoy station. The hotel
      also offers a complimentary shuttle that can take PCS participants
      to UNM's main campus. Availabiltiy of the shuttle is however
      limited; inquire at the hotel's front desk for details. The PCS
      local organizing committee will also pick up some out-of-state
      participants from the hotel each morning of the workshop. Details
      will be shared closer to the workshop. <br>
